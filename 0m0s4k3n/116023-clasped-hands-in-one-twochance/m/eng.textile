You think One accident was enough? Wrong!

Well…Let me break it down…

Funny thing is,This is a Chance Omo fic so…Call Chance a Pee Pee boy:3

Chance was just busy gambling his ass off and getting tails every single coin flip. Yes you could notice he’s crashing out by kicking a fucking wall in which killed his damn foot..Tossing Elliots Pizza in Noob’s Face in which was a helpful thing since Noob was at 11% Health

He/They crashed out so bad they grabbed handcuffs and tossed it in the air and boy…It hit Two-Time

The cultist was actually doing a generator during the time the precious handcuff flew into their area and clamped onto the floor with a “CLANK!”

“Hm…Oh what a glorious item spawn has gifted me from the above…Praise the spawn indeed…”

They turned and walked toward the item and picked it up, they examined it carefully, then they got interested in the handcuffs and placed it in their pocket and walked away

While walking around the abyssal area, they came across the raging gambler who fucking threw their coin so damn high they finally got a heads

Two-Time unclamped half the handcuff while they put it on their wrist, mistaking it for a bracelet and the other for a second one

And then…

”BUMP!”

The two non-binary’s hit eachother and flopped onto the ground with a small thud sound, but unexpectedly…

”Oh, My bad times!-“ “Oh no…! I should apologize for not loo-“

”Huh?”

“…”

Apparently the collision caused Two-Time to clasp the other “bracelet” to Chance’s hand in which causing it to “permanently” lock, causing them to be unable to seperate

“Fuck.”

”OH MY FUCKING GOD!”

Chance’s Scream echoed through the area, attracting other survivors attention, but by then the round had ended

Chance was trying to get unstuck while Two-Time just watched the whole scene unfold in-front of them, too tensed up by what happened to both of them at the moment

”Guys what’s wro- really.” Elliot cut himself off by the scene in front of him, Two-Time and Chance got clasped together by the handcuff in which had locked until someone had found a key “Ah, so that’s where my handcuffs went…” Guest replied with a stressful response

Chance rubbed his head in embarrassment at throwing away his handcuffs and gave them to the wrong person over a damn coin…A FUCK-ASS CO-

Ahem…Anyway:3

“You both have one minute to explain this.”

”Oh fuck.” Chance had tried to back up the evidence but Elliot was not having it, Seeing them like this seemed like they couldn’t be trusted to be put together

{{:

Oh boy…God forbid they gonna be stuck like that for eternity,No way Two-Time’s getting that Third life now😔

}}

So the whole lobby came to the conclusion that Two-Time and Chance should take many rounds off till they figure out how to get unstuck and away from their current predicament

The next round begun and Two-Time and Chance were just sitting there frozen until they decided to find something

But they forgot they got temporarily clasped together so they both fell and hit the floor with a thud,A small collision hitting across the wooden cabin floor

Both rubbed their heads in slight pain but got up, fell again, got up, fell again, got up, fell, up, fell, up, fell, (yeah no let’s not)

ANYWAAYY!!!

They chose to stick together the whole time they tried to find a way to get unstuck from the handcuffs,But… Boy… a new one was coming their way

Chance had been getting squirmy the more they proceeded to find the key to unlock the handcuffs from each other’s wrist

Two-Time had been asking Chance if he/they were alright, he/they had been rejecting Two-Time’s statements of their current issues

20 minutes have progressed and Chance had been getting more and more squirmy each passing minute, Two-Time had been getting slightly more worried about his/their issues in which had caused them to go nuts asking questions over and over

Chance has rejected atleast 16-17 times already, and he was gonna get pissed off, but Two-Time had a small pee kink in which caused them to stop asking more questions and they said silently

“Ok…You have asked for it..”

Chance held his/their crotch slightly tight each passing minute, Two-Time hadn’t found a key yet, nor has Chance found one yet, he/they were getting desperate

“Ugh…I gotta pi-“ “?” “NOTHING!!-“

Many more minutes have passed, Chance kept staring at the bathroom and gulping, they/he were stressing so bad about holding it in

10 minutes have passed, and Two-Time presses Chance’s bladder, which caused him/them to let out a moan and cuss at Two-Time, they pressed again, and again,

”T-Times stop I’m gonna..!-“

One more and that’s what happens when you press a bladder a bunch of times once it reaches its limit:3

The stream gushed out of Chance’s fingers and started dripping onto the floor with a pitter patter and the stream went straight down like a lightning bullet, shooting down like a rocket

Two-Time looked proud of themself and Chance was red…Too red to even see their/his original skin color

“Fuuuuuck….~” He/They moaned quietly

But something caught Two-Times eye, Straight up after Chance finished soaking himself, They walked over to it and lifted the coat

”Ah..there’s the key!”

“IT WAS THERE THIS WHOLE DAMN-…*Hic*”

”Oh my spawn…Wipe those tears..I’ll get you cleaned up alright?”

”O-Ok…”

They went in the bathroom together and Two-Time helped Chance clean up the mess he/they made, and they returned the handcuffs back to Guest
