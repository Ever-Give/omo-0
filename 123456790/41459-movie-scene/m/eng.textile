I just remembered a cute movie scene that involves male desperation. A newlywed couple is on a road trip to their honeymoon destination. The guy initially casually asks his wife to stop by the side of the road, but she ignores his request, saying that they will be there within an hour. As time goes by, he keeps asking and eventually begging her to let him out to pee on the side of the road. There are no other cars around, as they are headed to a remote village resort out in a forest for a relaxing week. She laughs at him and teases that he's not a small boy and can surely wait until they get there. When they arrive, the resort owners have a welcoming reception for the newlyweds, and a banquet dinner. My favorite part is when he tries (and fails) to act dignified and composed as he meets all the new people.

The movie never shows when the poor guy got to go for a pee, but I'm assuming it was before the dinner, because he looks relaxed by then.
