Chapter 5

Audrey picked at her lunch, her stomach still felt a bit sore, but she knew better than to turn down food when it was offered. She managed to force down about half of her meal before asking politely to be excused. Crowley started to tell her she could be when Aziraphale stopped him.

“Wait just a second dear, I think it would be wise for us to go over the rules if you are going to be staying here.” He said. His book was very specific about setting rules and boundaries with children and he thought that was perfectly sensible.

Audrey, however, took this to mean that she was in trouble. After all, the only time grown-ups wanted to talk about rules was when they wanted to tell her which one she’d broken. She began to bite her lip nervously, avoiding his eyes but not daring to leave the table. Crowley shot Aziraphale a look before cutting in.

“You’re not in trouble kid, you haven’t done anything wrong. It just might be nice to know what they are, yeah?” He said.

“No, of course you’re not in trouble dear, and the rules are for us, as well as you.” Aziraphale added, seeing his mistake.

“Ok…” Audrey said, confused and nervous about where this was heading.

“Let’s write them down,” Aziraphale said, grabbing a piece of paper from the counter. “Firstly, I’d like you to tell us if you need help. We are hardly mind readers and we cannot help you if we don’t know you need it.” He said firmly.

Audrey shifted nervously, knowing that she was unlikely to follow that rule.

“Second, we do not harm each other, no matter what happens.” Aziraphale continued. Audrey looked at him skeptically, unsure why he was saying ‘we’ instead of ‘you.’

“He means no one is hitting anyone, or doing anything else nasty for that matter. Wouldn’t exactly be fair to tell you to keep your hands to yourself and not have the same rule for us,” Crowley clarified. Audrey still wasn’t sure but she didn’t question it further.

“Third, we clean up after ourselves.” Said Aziraphale, writing the rules on the sheet. Crowley nodded, somewhat distracted as he thought about what toys they should get her, knowing telling a kid to clean their room only really mattered when there were toys to be picked up.

Audrey nodded again, a fresh wave of panic rising in her as she thought about the messes she’d already failed to clean up by herself. She had known it was too good to be true but she wasn’t ready to hear it out loud.

“Fourth, you may not leave the flat without us. Not that you’re a prisoner here of course, but it wouldn’t be safe for us to simply leave you on your own again,” said Aziraphale, as he finished writing.

“Does that all make sense kid?” Crowley asked, assuming the girl would have questions.

Audrey did have questions but she didn’t want to come off as a brat by questioning their rules, so she simply shook her head. Crowley looked at her in disbelief, he was pretty sure pushing and questioning the rules was a universal kid thing; it was part of why he liked them.

“Are you sure? You think they’re all fair?” He asked again. Audrey nodded again, doing her best to look confident.

“I’ll be good, I’m good at following rules,” she promised.

Crowley didn’t like the sound of that but he let it go, assuming she was still a bit shaken up from her accident.

“I’m going to hang them right here on the fridge, so if you forget them they will be right here for you.” Aziraphale said. His book had talked about the importance of having a copy of the rules children could see and he intended to follow the advice.

“Did you get enough lunch, kid?” Crowley asked, noticing Audrey’s half-full bowl.

“Yes, thank you so much, I won’t waste it, I can finish it,” she replied quickly grabbing her fork.

“You don’t have to finish it if you don’t want to kid, we can put it in the fridge.” Crowley told her, not wanting her to force herself to eat when her stomach was clearly upset.

“Yes please, I promise I’ll finish it later.” Audrey replied, incredibly relieved to not have to try to force it down.

“Well, what shall we do with the afternoon?” Aziraphale asked. He wasn’t completely unfamiliar with kids, but he’d always had a lesson to give, or a garden to tend. Having no structure was uncharted territory and he was rather uncomfortable in it.

Crowley shrugged, surprised to find himself facing the same dilemma. He’d always at least had toys to work with, or the goal of encouraging all-consuming evil. Their flat had very little to entertain a kid and he wasn’t eager to start coaching the next Angel of the Bottomless Pit.

“Maybe Audrey would enjoy some of the new kid’s books you’ve gotten?” he finally offered, hoping that Aziraphale would be able to miracle up at something that would interest her.

“Of course, why don’t we go have a look?” Aziraphale said, very excited at the prospect of the girl being interested in books.

Audrey was exhausted, having not gotten a proper nights sleep in weeks, she had managed to get some sleep the night before but it hadn’t been nearly enough to make up for all the nights she’d gone without. However, she heard Aziraphale’s enthusiasm and she didn’t want to upset him.

“That sounds great,” she said, getting up to follow him.

Aziraphale led her to a newly decorated kids corner down in the shop. It was stocked with the kid’s titles he’d heard of, as well as a number of the books that had appeared in the shop following the whole ordeal at the airbase. Audrey found that she was indeed interested by many of the books, especially the ones that included beautiful pictures.

“Are you sure I’m allowed?” She asked nervously. “I don’t have any money, I can’t buy any.”

“Of course you are allowed dear girl, take as many as you like.” Aziraphale told her.

Audrey was still unsure of herself but she ended up with a small stack of books including Where the Wild Things Are, The Lorax, and one called Zog, which Aziraphale had never heard of.

“Those look like excellent selections.” He praised her. “Why don’t we go back upstairs and we can read one together?”

Audrey nodded, letting him lead her back up to the flat’s living room. Crowley was walking around the flat, verbally assaulting the plants that had moved in with him, although he was careful to adjust his language when he heard them coming up the stairs.

Aziraphale sat down on the couch and motioned for Audrey to join him. She did so although she felt tense and awkward, no one had ever read to her before and she didn’t really know what she was supposed to do.

Aziraphale pulled the first book from the stack, feeling much more in his element with it in hand. He opened it and began to read, breaking out several voices he hadn’t used since Warlock was young and a certain nanny was in desperate need of a break.

Audrey relaxed as she lost herself in the story, which proved to be problematic. She knew it would be very rude to fall asleep while Aziraphale was reading to her, but with her stomach finally full and calm, and finally feeling warm and safe, she was having a hard time doing anything else. She wrapped her hand around her injured side; trying the same trick she’d used the night before. Pushing on the bruise didn’t hurt too badly at first, and it was effective. But by the time Aziraphale started the second story it was really making her uncomfortable.

She decided to move her hand, assuming she could manage to stay awake for a few minutes on her own. Aziraphale noticed her shifting around and began to rub her back, hoping to help her settle down. That worked a bit too well and he ended up with a child asleep against his shoulder less than five minutes later.

He was somewhat pleased with himself; glad the girl was getting some much-needed rest. He was also somewhat stuck, unable to move without jostling her.

“Crowley” he whispered, hoping the demon was close enough to hear him. “Crowwwleeyy, Crowwleyyy”

Finally the demon walked into the living room holding a plant-mister and a small, somewhat sickly looking seedling.

“Angel, why are you…” Crowley trailed off, seeing the problem. “You know, the whispering is not as quiet as you think it is.” He said, carefully picking the girl up, managing not to wake her.

“Well, dearest I was rather stuck.” Aziraphale said, getting up.

“Did that to yourself.” Crowley said, carrying the girl towards her bedroom. He was lucky enough to have some practice in this area, as Warlock had never willingly taken a nap.

###

Once she was settled he and Aziraphale ended up in the living room with a bottle of wine, feeling somewhat exhausted themselves.

“What time is it?” Crowley asked. He’d sprawled himself across Aziraphale and the sofa and couldn’t be bothered to move and check. Aziraphale managed to free his pocket-watch after a moment of struggle.

“Just after four, dear.”

“Seven-and-a-half-hours.” Crowley mumbled.

“Seven-and-a-half-hours until what dearest?”

“No, angel, since. Seven-and-a-half-hours since she woke up. Seven-and-a-half-hours and I’m so tired I could sleep for a month. We didn’t even do anything!” Crowley complained.

“Well it was rather nerve-wracking, wasn’t it?” Aziraphale said, letting his head flop back against the sofa.

“That might be the understatement of the century angel. I swear, she’s so afraid all the time, it feels like my skin is being misted with holy water.”

Aziraphale turned to face Crowley, jostling him in the process. The demon groaned.

“Why exactly is it affecting your skin dear?” he asked, very concerned.

Crowley groaned again.

“It’s nothing angel. Stop moving.” Crowley said, trying to wiggle his way back into a comfortable position. Aziraphale forced him to sit up instead.

“Dear, you can’t just say you’re in pain and then expect me to ignore it, especially if you’re going to call me your husband.” He said.

Crowley groaned yet again, accepting defeat.

“Fine angel. You can sense love right?”

“Well, yes, I suppose. I can sense when something is loved, although it’s easier when the feeling is close or exceptionally strong. And it has to be true love, not lust or surface affection or…” Crowley cut him off.

“Well, I may have lost that in the fall but turns out She couldn’t take it completely.” Crowley said. Aziraphale remained confused.

“I can feel it when humans are especially afraid, at least when its very intense or when I go looking for it. It can be somewhat annoying; fearful lot humans.” Crowley clarified.

“But that hardly makes any sense. Why would She want demons to be able to feel fear? Hatred or spookiness seems far more appropriate.” Aziraphale said, trying to make sense of the new information.

“For the last time angel, no one goes around sensing spookiness. And you shouldn’t ask questions you won’t like the answers to.”

“What do you mean? None of us have the answers, the whole thing is…”

“This isn’t ineffable. It’s easy to convince the loving to do heavenly things, and it’s easy to convince the fearful to do hellish ones. Makes horrifically perfect sense.” Crowley was becoming a bit ruthless with his desire to get away from this particular topic.

Aziraphale finally took the hint and let it drop.

“How do we get the poor dear to be less afraid then?” he mused. “I’ve told her repeatedly she has no reason to be, but she clearly doesn’t believe it.”

“It hasn’t been long enough angel, she’s not going to trust you just because you tell her to.”

“But it would make it so much easier if she did. I’m an angel for go…someone’s sake, the humans are supposed to innately trust me.” He pouted.

“Well, she’s let you bathe her and hold her, which is far more than I would have expected on the first day.” Crowley said, still a bit put out that the girl seemed to gravitate towards Aziraphale.

“You’re the one who had her playing games earlier, she’s hardly said 15 words to me.” Aziraphale said, still sulking.

“Yeah, she had warmed up a bit before her stupid corporation betrayed her. You see now why I didn’t want to feed her a full fry up?” Crowley comforted himself knowing he’d been right about at least one thing today.

“Yes, although it appears she still could have done with something blander. Perhaps toast or rice would be good for dinner.” Aziraphale mused.

Crowley shook his head, sighing.

“It’s just going to be rough for a bit, I think. Her body is exacting its revenge now that it knows she’s not starving.”

“Poor dear, I do hope it’s not too bad. Are you sure you can’t just fix it? It would only be one small miracle, surely bellow wouldn’t notice.” Aziraphale attempted to tempt the demon.

“It’s not really something that can be miracled away. It’s not healing so much as her corporation recalibrating itself a bit. And at any rate, we really shouldn’t be performing any unnecessary miracles, at least not on humans. That type of thing draws attention.” Crowley said unhappily.

“Well, we ought to keep a careful eye on it then. She may need to see a human doctor if nothing else.” Aziraphale said, finally leaning back on the couch so Crowley could sprawl across him again.

“We ought to rest while we can Angel. I’m sure she’ll be up soon enough.” Crowley closed his eyes. Aziraphale hummed in agreement, reaching for his book and carefully balancing it on Crowley’s back, hoping to find some answers while the demon napped.

Aaaaaaannnnndddd Chapter 6

Audrey slept for just over an hour, mercifully she was still too tired to dream. She woke slowly, struggling to remember where she was and how she’d gotten there. She was sure she’d been on the couch when she fell asleep. Soon it came back to her and she found herself hoping she hadn’t offended Aziraphale too badly.

She stretched and shifted, feeling uncomfortable, as her legs and bum were cold and wet. She froze at the realization, this couldn’t be happening. Not again, not so soon after the first time. And definitely not right after they’d told her the rules and she’d promised to follow them. This was definitely her mess, and she was sure she needed to clean it up, but she had no idea how to actually do that. She didn’t know where their washing machine was or how it worked, and she couldn’t go looking for it without getting caught. Lost, she stared down at the bed trying her best to come up with a plan.

Audrey decided that if she could wait until the middle of the night she might be able to get things washed while they were asleep. It would also give her a reason not to fall asleep again. She balled up the sheets and hid them under her bed, as far back as she could get them. Then there was the problem of her clothes; her shirt and socks were fine, but she was sure they’d notice the smell even if she hid until her pants dried. She went looking in the wardrobe and managed to find another pair of black pants; similar enough she thought they would notice. She found herself some clean underwear as well and got changed, not bothering to clean herself up since she didn’t have anything to clean up with. She hid the pants with her sheets and pulled the duvet over the bed.

Once she finished hiding the evidence Audrey wasn’t sure what to do with herself. She puttered around the room for a while, but aside from the closet of clothes there wasn’t much to be explored. She then tried to sit quietly, but she got bored quickly and she realized she was also very hungry. Asking them for food seemed like a very dangerous idea, but then she remembered Crowley had put her plate from lunch in the fridge. She would probably at least be allowed to have that. Doing her best to be brave she headed to the kitchen.

Aziraphale heard the fridge open and roused Crowley, who was still napping on top of him.

Audrey found the bowl in the fridge and had just pulled it out when a sleepy eyed demon and slightly more awake angel stumbled into the room.

“I’m just finishing my food from earlier, I promise I’m not taking anything else!” Audrey said quickly. She knew better than to steal food and she didn’t want to get kicked out for something she wasn’t even doing.

“Relax kid, its fine. Give it here and I’ll warm it up for you,” Crowley said, putting out his had for the bowl.

“Did you have a nice nap, dear girl?” Aziraphale asked.

“Yes, thank you, I’m sorry I fell asleep.” Audrey responded nervously, avoiding his eyes.

“That’s quite all right dear, you needed the rest.”

“Come eat kid.” Crowley said, setting her a place at the table.

“Thank you,” Audrey said, hesitantly sitting down.

Not wanting to just sit and watch her eat Crowley began to make a pot of tea, figuring it would be good for him and the angel. Aziraphale settled himself at the table with a packet of biscuits Audrey found herself eyeing.

“Would you like one?” Aziraphale said, holding out the package.

“After she finishes her lunch angel.” Crowley said over his shoulder.

“I don’t need one, you can have them.” Audrey said quickly.

“You can absolutely have one kid, he doesn’t need to eat all of the biscuits and he knows it. Just finish your spaghetti first.” Crowley said, sitting down at the table with them and taking a biscuit himself to show her it was allowed.

Audrey quietly finished her food; worried their bickering was going to turn into a fight and not wanting to be in the middle of it.

When he noticed she was done Aziraphale held out the package of biscuits to her.

“Have some dear,” He offered kindly. Watching both men carefully Audrey took one out of the package and took a small bite.

“Thank you,” she said quickly, remembering her manners.

###

Once everyone had had something to eat and drink they ended up sitting somewhat awkwardly around the kitchen table. Audrey was still nervous around them and they were still unsure what to do with her. She shifted uncomfortably, feeling itchy and gross because she hadn’t cleaned up earlier.

“How about another movie? I think Mulanhas a sequel.” Crowley finally offered, breaking the silence.

“I think that sounds lovely dear, does that suit you Audrey?” Aziraphale said. Truthfully he didn’t like the idea of sitting the girl in front of the TV again, but he also didn’t have a single better idea.

“That sounds good, I can clean up first though, I know better than to leave a mess.” She said, bringing her bowl to the sink and starting the water.

“It’s fine kid, we’ll get it.” Crowley said, not liking how neurotic she was about the cleaning. Audrey looked at him nervously but she did put the bowl down and follow them into the living room.

They settled on the couch, although it took Audrey quite a bit of shifting to find a comfortable position. Crowley gave her a confused look as she did so, fairly certain her clothes were slightly different but not able to point to anything specific.

Once she was comfortable Audrey managed to get wrapped up in the movie and she found some of the tension leaving her body. Eventually she even let herself lean against Aziraphale, and the Angel beamed with pride knowing she was feeling a bit more comfortable.

Crowley spent the last bit of the film trying to come up with some ideas of things to do with the girl. He was deeply unsettled by her near-muteness and determined to get her out of her shell a bit.

As the credits rolled he focused on Imagining a small game cabinet, Expecting it to contain the few kid’s games he remembered. Sure enough, when they got up to stretch and turn the lights back on he spotted a new cabinet in the corner.

“We have a bit of time before dinner kid, want to play a game?” He offered.

“Can we?” Audrey asked excitedly. “I mean if you want to. You don’t have to play with me I can take care of myself,” she amended quickly.

“I definitely want to.” Crowley said, opening the cabinet and surveying the games inside. “Think you can beat me at Trouble?” He asked her holding out the box.

“Let’s play dear girl, I think it will be fun,” Aziraphale told her, happy to let Crowley take the lead.

Seeing that both men wanted to play Audrey let herself get a bit excited.

“Ok, but I don’t know how to play.” She told them, the hint of a smile on her lips.

Chapter 7

The game turned out to be a big hit. Audrey had a competitive streak and despite her best attempts to hide it she was quickly wrapped up in trying to beat Crowley. Crowley had planned on letting her win, but when she began sending his pieces back to home every other turn he found his own competitiveness showing. Aziraphale refused to take anyone’s pieces on principal; at least until Audrey and Crowley ganged up on him and set him back to square one.

“Now that is just rude!” He complained, pouting at Crowley as the demon put his last piece back at the start.

Audrey looked at them nervously; worried she’d gotten herself in trouble. Crowley, on the other hand, felt no remorse. Noting Audrey’s nervous expression he stuck his tongue out at the Angel, trying to make it clear they were only play-fighting.

“It’s your own fault Angel. You could have sent me back three times now.”

“Yes, but that seemed rather rude, it’s much harder to win if your pieces have to start over.”

“That’s the point Angel, you’re not supposed to make it easy for us to win, you’re supposed to try to win yourself.” Crowley said exasperated.

“Well if I’d done that the game would have ended six turns ago.” Aziraphale said haughtily.

“Go on then, show us how its done, I’m sure we can beat you even if you actually make an effort.” Crowley taunted.

Audrey snickered quietly, knowing this to be true. While they’d been bickering she’d been studying the board quietly and she was pretty sure she could win the game within the next few rounds.

“Fine then, we’ll play your way you fiend.” Aziraphale said, rolling and taking one of his pieces out of the start yet again.

“Let’s get him kid.” Crowley said, looking at Audrey. She looked back at him nervously, she was sure Aziraphale couldn’t win, but if she wanted to she would have to beat Crowley too.

“Don’t let him trick you into an alliance dear girl. I’m already beaten, you ought to go after him.” Aziraphale urged her.

Audrey didn’t like this attention at all and shrank into herself a bit. Thankfully, Crowley was quick to realize their mistake.

“Go after whoever you like kid, I’ll beat you both if I need to.” He taunted.

After a moment of hesitation Audrey took her turn, and within a few minutes she’d won the game. She giggled as she put the last piece down.

Crowley looked at her, his mouth wide open, not even having to fake his surprise.

“That was impressive kid, very sneaky,” He praised her.

“I think we ought to start something for dinner dearest.” Aziraphale said, checking the time and realizing it had gotten rather late.

“I can do it, I don’t need to be a burden, I can earn my keep.” Audrey said quickly, scrambling to her feet, the nervous expression returning to her face.

“You can help if you like, but we’ll be doing most of the cooking kid, it’s not your job.” Crowley said, getting to his feet.

“You are not a burden dear girl. Put that dreadful thought out of your head.” Aziraphale said firmly as he led her towards the kitchen.

Audrey ducked her head, mistaking his tone for anger directed at her.

“I’m thinking chicken noodle soup for dinner,” Crowley said, knowing it would be easy on the girl’s stomach.

“That sounds lovely dearest.” Aziraphale said approvingly, pulling out ingredients.

Audrey waited quietly to be given a task. Aziraphale handed her carrots and a peeler, and after instructing her to be very careful he let her peel the carrots mostly on her own.

Soon there was a pot simmering on the stove and a lovely smell wafting through the flat.

“Nothing to do now but wait, why don’t you go play kid. We’ll do the dishes.” Crowley offered; knowing Audrey had been with them for a while and wanting to give her some time on her own.

Audrey wanted to argue that she could help them clean but she wasn’t feeling very well and she decided to take the way out when it was offered. She went back to her room and lowered her pants enough to peek at the itchy skin around her thighs and groin. It was red and raw and seeing it just made her feel worse.

She thought about going to the bathroom to try to clean up but quickly decided against it. Bathrooms had not been pleasant since she’d been at home and even though she logically knew the one here was safe it still made her feel uneasy.

Trying to distract herself she picked up one of the books she’d taken earlier and curled up in a comfy chair. She lost herself in the story for a while, until her stomach dragged her back to reality. This time she recognized the rumbling feeling immediately, but she still found herself eager to ignore it rather than braving the bathroom. She knew it was a stupid fear, but knowing that just made her feel worse.

Eventually her body made it clear that she had no choice, unless she wanted to have another accident. She forced herself out of the room and across the hall, pausing at the bathroom door.

It would be fine. She knew it was safe and clean. The door closed and locked, and she was sure no one was inside. However, she still found herself almost frozen with fear, considering all the things that had happened between friend’s houses, and the few other places she’d found to stay in the past month.

Another cramp forced her out of her own head and she managed to force herself into the room. She used the toilet as quickly as she possibly could; feeling like her heart was in her throat. As soon as she felt like she could be done she hopped off and flushed, not bothering to wipe or wash her hands in her rush to get out of the room. She all but ran back across the hall, glad to be done with the whole ordeal.

Audrey spent the next twenty minutes becoming increasingly uncomfortable. She was itchy and felt gross and she was sure she smelled bad. When Crowley called her for dinner she thought about saying she wasn’t hungry, but then she remembered how they’d come to get her at lunch and decided that even though her wet sheets were hidden she really didn’t want them in the room.

Crowley looked at her suspiciously as she walked into the kitchen, sure something was off but not able to put his finger on what it was.

“Wash your hands and come sit down kid.” He told her, ladling soup into bowls. He’d heard the toilet flush earlier and noted that he hadn’t heard the sink; having learned to pay attention to such things with Warlock.

Audrey did as she was told before sitting down at the table, wincing as she did so but not showing any other outward signs of pain. She was quiet throughout dinner, despite both men trying to get her to talk. She was careful not to be rude of course, but they couldn’t get her to say more than a few syllables. Crowley assumed she was just tired and let it go.

“Let’s get you ready for bed kid,” Crowley said as he put the bowls in the sink. “There should be some clean pajamas in your wardrobe.” He turned to lead the way.

“I can do it, I don’t need help,” Audrey said, jumping up herself and scrambling to get ahead of him.

“All right kid, if you want to that‘s fine, we’ll come tuck you in in a few minutes,” He told her skeptically. He wanted to know what had her so nervous but he didn’t want to invade her privacy to find out.

“I don’t need to be tucked in, I’m a big kid.” She said fiercely.

“All right kid, if you’re sure. But you come get us if you need us, ok?” Crowley said, taken aback by her tone.

“I won’t need anything.” She told him, trying her best to sound confident. She walked out of the kitchen before he had time to ask her any more questions, leaving him standing by the sink trying to figure out what had just happened.

*007*2020-05-05 22:14

Aziraphale watched Audrey all but run out of the kitchen, at a loss for what to say or do.

“Dearest, are you sure she should be left alone? She seemed rather upset, although I’m not sure why.” He said, looking somewhat helplessly at Crowley.

Crowley shrugged, feeling out of his league. He’d taken in kids but it had been centuries since he’d done so without some demonic objective and the long day had him feeling a bit overwhelmed.

“I suppose if she says she wants to be left alone we ought to leave her. She’s been on her own for long enough she can definitely take care of herself. She’s probably just feeling a bit smothered.” He mused. He began to do the dishes the human way, needing something to do with his hands.

“I think I’ll stay up with you tonight though.”

Aziraphale didn’t protest, he wasn’t eager to be left in charge of the child; at least until they knew what was wrong.

“Perhaps some coffee then, dear.” He said, already beginning to make it. Crowley nodded, internally questioning whether Vodka wouldn’t be more appropriate.

Crowley finished washing dishes, and moved to be next to his Angel.

“There’s something wrong. I don’t know what it is, but there’s something wrong.” He muttered.

“Well yes dear, I’d gathered as much myself. You’re the one with the child rearing talents, are you certain you have no idea?” Aziraphale asked.

“I mean she’s scared, that much goes without saying, but I don’t know why she suddenly wants nothing to do with us. My glasses didn’t slip during dinner did they?” Crowley said, wracking his brain for answers.

“Not that I saw dearest, and I think that would have garnered a more immediate reaction anyway. Did I say anything that could have upset her again? I haven’t mentioned anyone outside the shop or anything of that sort have I?”

“You barely said anything at all, and I can’t imagine any of what you did say would scare her. But we do need to do something about the hiding in the shop bit. She needs clothes and toys that haven’t just been miracled here, and we can’t leave the shop closed forever. At some point we’ll have to deal with her jackass of a father and whoever else might be looking.” Crowley said, eager to focus on problems they knew how to solve.

“Perhaps we could order some things, dear? I still have a few humans I could send on an assignment without too much trouble.” Aziraphale offered. Crowley put his finger up, remembering something.

“Not that, but basically that, let me get my laptop.” He said scurrying out of the room and returning a moment later to his confused Angel. “Inventive lot humans, who would have guessed they’d find a way to make sloth efficient.” He said, sitting down at the table and pulling up a website full of just about everything they could hope to order. Aziraphale sat down next to him.

“But dearest, if you order it by post won’t it take time? She really could use some new things tomorrow, ideally by the time she wakes up. I don’t know how many more movies I can watch.”

“Two hour shipping Angel, and I’m fairly certain they’ll conveniently have everything in stock.” Crowley explained, already scrolling through the listing of toys.

“How on earth; they’d need a small army to make that work. The prices must be absurd. And where are they possibly storing it all?”

“Cheapest on the market Angel, they undercut the other giants by a few cents every week. Just because they have an army doesn’t mean they pay them properly. Last I heard they were tracking them with clever little GPS chips, regulating bathroom breaks and walking speed and everything. It’s amazing what humans will force each other to do for money.”

“Is it one of yours then? The M-25’s dastardly cousin?” Aziraphale asked, clearly planning to scold the demon.

“Nah, they came up with this one all on their own. They love convenience, and as long as the cruelty of it is hidden they couldn’t care less.” Crowley said, offended at being implicated.

“And yet you plan to give them a small fortune,” Aziraphale said, watching the prices add up.

“Can’t be helped tonight, we’ll tip the delivery guy well.” Crowley promised.

Roughly two hours later they were unpacking a box of toys, clothes and a few other items Crowley had deemed necessary.

Outside the shop an unknown delivery driver received a job offer for a position he’d looked at but deemed himself unqualified to actually apply for. He returned the truck to the warehouse and left if there, not even bothering to take the keys back inside the building.

Aziraphale looked at the mass of products, trying to sort out what they were all for. The toys mostly made sense, with the exception of a small electronic object that looked like a fattened version of Crowley’s mobile. The demon followed his gaze.

“Videogame, a good one at that. Kid’s love ‘em and they’re a great distraction. This one can connect to the TV too. One of Warlock’s bratty friends had the first version.” He explained.

“You don’t intend to have her spend all of her time in front of a screen do you dearest?” Aziraphale asked, clearly disapproving of the idea.

“Course not Angel, but I don’t intend to spend all of my time playing Trouble either. If she’s going to be cooped up here she’ll need some things she can play by herself.” Crowley said.

Aziraphale picked up another package, which looked to contain strange underwear and had a child much younger than Audrey on it. On closer inspection he realized they were some sort of nappies.

“This hardly seems necessary dearest, and I’m sure she’ll be mortified if you try it.” He said, holding the package up to Crowley.

“They’re just training pants Angel, and I’m not going to do anything about it unless she keeps having issues. But it’ll be better to have them and not need them then the other way around.” Crowley said.

“But won’t it be upsetting for her? Children are very sensitive about such things if I remember correctly.”

“Well, yeah, but you saw how scared she was today, at least this way she should know we won’t be upset if she has an accident, and she doesn’t have to be worried about making a mess.” Crowley said, questioning his reasoning a bit. “Hopefully we won’t need them anyway.” He added, miracling them to under the bathroom sink to get them out of sight and end the argument. Aziraphale let it go.

Audrey was determined to avoid falling asleep tonight. She paced around her room for a while, but she was exhausted and soon she found herself tripping over her own feet. She decided she would probably be ok as long as she didn’t sit down and she ended up leaned against the wall listening. She could hear the men talking, but couldn’t quite make out what they were saying. She leaned her forehead against the wall, hoping they would go to bed soon so she could at least try to wash her sheets.

A few minutes later she found herself sliding to the floor, having nearly fallen asleep standing up. She sat on the floor, digging her fingers into her sides. The pain woke her up a bit and focused her and she kept her hands where they were even when it got bad enough to bring her to tears. She managed to keep that up until she heard them walk downstairs.

Assuming they would be gone for a bit she gathered the balled up sheets and started to open the door, only to hear them come up the stairs and start tearing open boxes in the living room. Feeling utterly defeated she sank back down to the ground and curled up on top of the dirty sheets in tears. She was just so tired and so overwhelmed that this latest setback was too much for her to take. Eventually she cried herself out and ended up asleep on the floor.
